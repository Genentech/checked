# Running Checks

Although `checked` is broadly capable of running arbitrary sets of `R
CMD check` tasks, reverse dependency checking is one of the most common
use cases where batch `R CMD check`s are needed.

Running reverse dependency checks is as easy as

``` r
library(checked)
x <- run("/home/dev/praise")
results(x)
```

    #> # Revdep Check Task Spec 
    #> 
    #> goodpractice package R CMD check diff 
    #> notes: OK 
    #> warnings: OK 
    #> errors: OK 
    #> 
    #> testthat package R CMD check diff 
    #> notes: OK 
    #> warnings: OK 
    #> errors: OK

## Monitoring Runs

Because running many checks in parallel can be a difficult process to
monitor, capable interfaces will provide a convenient output for
tracking various runs, check results and package installations; keeping
a log of any issues that might arise during the process.

If your editor doesnâ€™t support the full output, you might consider
launching your checks in a terminal which should be less constrained.
This would also free up your preferred editor for you to use while your
checks run.

``` r
library(checked)
run("/home/dev/praise")
```
